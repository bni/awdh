# Andy Warhols Debbie Harry portrait from 1985/1986

## Reconstruction of this historic digital image

Original file was most likely lost in the sands of time.

There is a photo of the image on a CRT screen, where individual phosphors can be seen, in the Amiga World Magazine from January 1986.

Work in progress in IFF/ILBM format: [awdh.iff](https://raw.github.com/bni/awdh/main/awdh.iff)

## Workflow
Automated sampling to get a rough draft with correct proportions.

Manual fix-up in Deluxe Paint III. Using zoomed photo fragments as pixel reference.

Missing parts guessed with help of other photos.

Not enough info exists to get a 100% authentic result, but maybe close to 95%.
